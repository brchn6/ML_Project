# ML Course Project

## Overview
The objective of this project is to predict readmission of diabetic patients. This objective was predefined as a binary classification task.
The dataset we worked on is the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999 â€“ 2008 from the UC Irvine ML Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008.
Description of the original features can be found in the supplemental information of the original research paper (see also data/IDS_mapping.csv).
Description of features that were engineered or grouped for this project can be found below in the files description section.  
  
A detailed overview of the project and a summary of the results are written in Project_Summary.docsx
